# Aim

# Contribute

Psycho.jl is a young package in need of affection. You can easily hop aboard the developpment of this open-source software and improve psychological science:

- Create new or check existing **`bug`** issues to report, replicate, understand or solve some bugs.
- Create new or check existing **`feature idea`** issues to suggest or discuss a new feature.
- Check existing **`help us if you're reading this`** issues to see things that we'd like to implement, but where help is needed to do it.
- Check existing **`what's your opinion`** issues to give your opinion and participate in package's design discussions.

Don't be shy, try to code and submit a pull request (PR). Even if unperfect, we will help you make it great! All contributors will be very graciously rewarded someday :smirk:.
