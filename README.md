# Aim

***"From Julia to Manuscript"***

Enough of *copy/pasting*, manual formatting and searching *what* to report and *how* to report it! `Psycho`'s primary goal is to fill the gap between Julia's output and the formatted result description of your manuscript, with the use of **best practices** guidelines, ensuring standardization and quality of results reporting.
It also provides useful tools and functions for psychologists, neuropsychologists and neuroscientists for their everyday data analysis.

# Contribute

`Psycho.jl` is a young package in need of affection. You can easily hop aboard the developpment of this open-source software and improve psychological science doing the following:

- Create new or check existing <a href=https://github.com/neuropsychology/Psycho.jl/issues><img src="docs/src/assets/issue_bug.png" height="25"></a> issues to report, replicate, understand or solve some bugs.
- Create new or check existing <a href=https://github.com/neuropsychology/Psycho.jl/issues><img src="docs/src/assets/issue_featureidea.png" height="25"></a> issues to suggest or discuss a new feature.
- Check existing <a href=https://github.com/neuropsychology/Psycho.jl/issues><img src="docs/src/assets/issue_help.png" height="25"></a> issues to see things that we'd like to implement, but where help is needed to do it.
- Check existing <a href=https://github.com/neuropsychology/Psycho.jl/issues><img src="docs/src/assets/issue_opinion.png" height="25"></a> issues to give your opinion and participate in package's design discussions.

Don't be shy, try to code and submit a pull request (PR). Even if unperfect, we will help you make it great! All contributors will be very graciously rewarded someday :smirk:.
